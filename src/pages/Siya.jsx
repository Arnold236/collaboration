          <h3>Experience with Programming Languages</h3>
          <p>
            In Java, Siyabonga honed his object-oriented programming skills, building robust and scalable applications. Python became his go-to language for scripting and data analysis, where its simplicity and powerful libraries allowed him to experiment with different algorithms and data models. JavaScript, on the other hand, opened the doors to web development, enabling him to create dynamic and interactive user interfaces. With ABAP, Siyabonga delved into the world of enterprise applications, gaining insights into how large-scale business processes are automated and managed.

          <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
          <p>
            But Siyabonga is not just a coder. When he’s not deep in the world of programming, you can find him on the football pitch, where he serves as the first-choice goalkeeper for his local team. Siyabonga’s skills between the posts are nothing short of impressive, earning him comparisons to the legendary South African goalkeeper, Itumeleng Khune. Whether it’s a high-flying shot or a tricky one-on-one, Siyabonga’s quick reflexes and sharp decision-making make him a formidable presence in goal. Football also plays a crucial role in keeping him fit and healthy, balancing the hours spent behind a computer screen.

          <p>
            Beyond football, Siyabonga has a fascination with rockets, particularly SpaceX's Starship. The sheer scale of ambition behind the Starship project inspires him, and he often spends his free time following the latest developments in space exploration. For Siyabonga, the challenge of reaching Mars parallels his own journey in software development—both require perseverance, innovation, and a relentless pursuit of excellence.
